<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>This volume of brief selections from a wide range of Southern expression
in prose and verse leads into fields of American history and literature
which, perhaps, are not well known to the general public. The reader is
not offered stacks of straw to thresh over; on the contrary, it has been
the aim of the compiler, in a most congenial and delightful task, to
afford others easy access to grain that he has already garnered. Generally
speaking, the genius of literary production in the Old South did not
aspire to an outlet in the field of professional endeavor. There were,
however, many gifted writers who regarded production in prose and verse as
a pleasant recreation rather than an end, or as an accomplishment common
to cultured minds, to be called forth as occasion offered, or when some
emotion prompted expression.</p>

<p>By way of illustration, William Henry Timrod may be regarded as
potentially a greater poet than his better-known son. Yet he was one of
the occasional poets of the old régime. John Laurens composed a sonnet as
he lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> dying of wounds and fever incurred in defence of his country; and
Stuart, in a later struggle, wrote verses while engaged in riding around
McClellan’s army. These and many others like them never seriously
considered revising or publishing their work. They sang from time to time
because to them “singing itself is so sweet.” This peculiar diffidence is
a relic of the past; and at the present time, one need but review the list
of leading American novelists to find that a remarkably large proportion
have come from the South and write on Southern themes.</p>

<p>Thus, while the very nature of the South lends itself to sentiment and
romance, her history is yet to be written. This little volume attempts,
therefore, with particular care, to treat of historical events as their
anniversaries bring them to mind. Comparatively few are the enduring works
of Southern historians; and yet from the beginning of colonization the
South has thrilled with the record of daring achievement. In the work of
her soldiers and statesmen, the South led in shaping the Republic out of
rebellion, revolution, and jarring elements. During and after the struggle
with the mother country, Jefferson, Henry, Clark, and Virginia gave to the
Nation the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and
Wisconsin. It was Jefferson who secured to the Republic peaceful
possession of the vast original tract of Louisiana; and it was he, with
Lewis and Clark, who made good the claim to the Oregon territory.
Furthermore, the mighty empire of Texas and the far Southwest was brought
in under the initiative of the South and the leadership of Polk and Tyler.</p>

<p>So did the South mightily assist in making a common government great and
strong; but she was likewise building up a power which later overwhelmed
her. In truth, she forged the fetters that for forty years chafed her
people under an increasingly oppressive legislation; since it was a son of
Carolina who first brought forward a tariff for protection, not for
Carolina, but for New England and the Nation; and it was Clay of Kentucky
who fostered the system until it involved the thirteen agricultural States
of the South in an indirect taxation more burdensome than any direct
impost ever proposed by Great Britain for the thirteen Colonies. In vain
the South protested. Opposing majorities grew against her. And when a
solidly sectional party became the dominant power, the Lower South
attempted to exercise the hitherto generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> conceded right of
withdrawal, a right which had been particularly emphasized in New England
when that section felt its interests to be in peril. The Upper South
opposed coercion; and both prepared for the fight that followed. Such is
the principle for which the South contended. She failed not in valor or in
honor, but fell through exhaustion; yet glory stood beside her grief, and
she endowed the Nation with the stainless names of Lee and Jackson.</p>

<p>With the failure of the South to establish her independence, there fell
also, as an incident of the struggle, that which most made her a separate
section, politically, economically, and socially&mdash;the tutelage, in the
most beneficent form of servitude ever known, of a child-race. That race
was largely thrust upon her; and yet she raised its people from cannibal
savages to civilized beings, whose devotion and faithfulness became the
marvel of invading armies. Rather than interpret such a record to her
shame, as some would have us do, let it be proclaimed as an everlasting
tribute to the lofty character of Anglo-Saxon Christianity.</p>

<p>The South, after fifty years, is more intimately a part of the Union than
ever before. Her interests are national and her destiny great. In the
youthful Bagley she was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> first to give her blood in the war with
Spain, therewith cementing the tie that now, without fetters, binds in a
steadily growing amity and understanding. To-day, a true Southerner has an
abiding love and loyalty for the section that has seen tears and grief, as
well as sunshine and flowers, beyond the measure of any country of modern
times; but he is also doubly true to, and proud of, the mighty progress of
a reunited Republic. Surely it is due to the South and due to the Nation
that the story of the South be told. And the highest aim of the compiler
of these selections is that he may contribute something to promote that
steadily expanding knowledge of historical truth which alone can fully
allay the spirit of sectional strife, and from which alone we may look for
perfect amity and understanding to ensue.</p>

Some thunder on the heights of song, their race<br />
Godlike in power, while others at their feet<br />
Are breathing measures scarce less strong and sweet<br />
Than those that peal from out that loftiest place;<br />
Meantime, just midway on the mount, his face<br />
Fairer than April heavens, when storms retreat,<br />
And on their edges rain and sunshine meet,<br />
Pipes the soft lyrist lays of tender grace,<br />
But where the slopes of bright Parnassus sweep<br />
Near to the common ground, a various throng<br />
Chant lowlier measures&mdash;yet each tuneful strain<br />
(The silvery minor of earth’s perfect song)<br />
Blends with that music of the topmost steep,<br />
O’er whose vast realm the master minstrels reign!<br />

<p>Few have equaled the old time negro at repartee, and a true Southerner
heartily relished a clever rejoinder to his good natured raillery. The
rejoinder was frequently overwhelming, always respectful, and generally
worth an immediate acknowledgment in cash or old clothes.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Peter?” called an old Confederate to his former body-servant
on the road.</p>

<p>Peter grinned broadly as he doffed his hat. “Yas, suh, dis yer me.”</p>

<p>“Well, well!” laughed the other. “I see that all the old fools are not
dead yet.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s so, Mars’ Tom.” Peter pulled his grizzly forelock appreciatively.
“I’s monsus glad to see dat you’s in such good health, suh.”</p>

<p>A WELL-KNOWN TYPE OF SOUTHERN MATRON BEFORE THE WAR</p>

<p>Full well she knew the seriousness of life. Over and over the cares and
responsibilities of her station as the mother of so many children, the
mistress of so many servants and the hostess of so many guests, had
utterly overwhelmed her. * * * * * Into how many negro cabins had she not
gone, when the night was far spent and the lamp of life flickered low in
the breast of the dying slave! How often she ministered to him with her
own hands! * * * * Nay, had she not knelt by his lowly bed and poured out
her heart to God as his soul winged its flight, and closed his glazed and
staring eyes as the day was dawning? Yet the morning meal found her at her
accustomed seat, tranquil and helpful, and no one but her husband the
wiser for her night’s ministrations.</p>

on January 9, 1861, as a corporal of artillery, fired a single shot
from Fort Moultrie to challenge the <i>Star of the West</i> in its attempt
to reinforce Fort Sumter. On the same occasion two other shots were
fired by the State cadets stationed on Morris Island, driving the
transport from the harbor. It is not improbable, therefore, that, as
the challenger of the hostile steamer, the writer of these verses
fired the first shot of the war between the States. Corporal Clarkson
was in charge of gun No. 13.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Editor</span>]</p>

<p>SECESSION: A SOUTHERN VIEW, 1861</p>

<p>A State, finding herself in the condition in which Mississippi has judged
she is&mdash;in which her safety requires that she should provide for the
maintenance of her rights out of the Union&mdash;surrenders all the benefits
(and they are known to be many), deprives herself of the advantages (and
they are known to be great), severs all the ties of affection (and they
are close and enduring), which have bound her to the Union; and thus
divesting herself of every benefit&mdash;taking upon herself every burden&mdash;she
claims to be exempt from any power to execute the laws of the United
States within her limits.</p>

would have been astounded to see how many thousands and tens of thousands
in the Southern States felt the crushing burden and the awful
responsibility of the institution which we were supposed to be defending
with the melodramatic fury of pirate kings. We were born to this social
order, we had to do our duty in it according to our lights, and this duty
was made indefinitely more difficult by the interference of those who, as
we thought, could not understand the conditions of the problem, and who
did not have to bear the expense of the experiments they proposed.</p>

<p>VALLEY FORGE EXCEEDED</p>

<p>Starvation, literal starvation, was doing its deadly work. So depleted and
poisoned was the blood of many of Lee’s men from insufficient and unsound
food that a slight wound which would probably not have been reported at
the beginning of the war would often cause blood-poison, gangrene, and
death. Yet the spirits of these brave men seemed to rise as their
condition grew more desperate.... It was a harrowing but not uncommon
sight to see those hungry men gather the wasted corn from under the feet
of half-fed horses, and wash and parch and eat it to satisfy in some
measure their craving for food.</p>

<p>While the Confederate soldiers were in the trenches, the ingenuity of the
Southern women was taxed to the utmost to supply their household needs.
Medicine had been declared contraband of war by the Federal Government,
and salt works were made a special object for attack. Remedies were
improvised from herbs of all kinds; the dirt floor of the meat house was
boiled for the salt it contained; soap was made from china-berries and
lye; candles out of resin or waxed rope wound around a corncob; thorns
were used for pins; shoes were fashioned out of canvas, and supplied with
wooden soles; buttons were made from persimmon seed; tumblers out of glass
bottles; tea out of berry leaves; and coffee was made from sweet potatoes
and dandelion seed.</p>

<p class="poem">
Like some rough brute that roams the forest wild,<br />
So rude, uncouth, so purely Nature’s child,<br />
Is “Hickory,” and yet methinks I see<br />
The stamp of genius on his brow; and he,<br />
With his mild glance and keen, but quiet eye,<br />
Can draw forth from the secret recess where they lie<br />
Those thoughts and feelings of the human heart<br />
Most virtuous, good, and free from guilty art.<br />
There’s something in his very mode of life<br />
So accurate, steady, void of care and strife,<br />
That fills my heart with love for him who bears<br />
His honors meekly and who wears<br />
The laurels of a hero! This is a fact,<br />
So here’s a heart and hand for “Jack!”<br />

<p>Wherein, then, lay his strength, and what was the secret of his influence
over all this land? I answer in one word&mdash;character. And what is meant by
character? Courage? Yes; courage of his opinions, and physical courage as
well; for he had a Briton’s faith in pluck. Pride of race? In a limited
sense, yes. Honesty? The question is almost an insult. Love of truth? Yes,
undying love of it.</p>

<p>If this bill passes, it is my deliberate opinion that it is virtually a

obligations, and as it will be the right of all, so it will be the duty of
some, definitely to prepare for a separation, amicably if they can,
violently if they must.</p>

Emperor of Russia, Knight of the Order of St. Ann; the King of Denmark,
Knight of the Dannebrog; the King of Portugal, Knight of the Tower and
Sword; the King of Belgium, Knight of the Order of St. Leopold;
simultaneously with Tennyson, he was awarded an LL.D. by the University of
Cambridge, England; he received honorary membership from a score of the
world’s leading societies of science and scholarship; the Pope conferred
upon him a noteworthy testimonial; the Emperor of Mexico gave him a
decoration; and Prussia, Austria, Sweden, Holland, Sardinia, Bremen, and
France struck medals in his honor as the greatest scientist of the New
World, and the peer of any in the Old.</p>

<p>* * * It was the most monstrous barbarity of the barbarous march. There is
no reason to think that General Sherman knew anything of the purpose to
burn the city, which had been freely talked about among the soldiers
through the afternoon. But there is reason to think that he knew well
enough who did it, that he never rebuked it, and made no effort to punish
it.</p>

<p>After the passage of the Anti-Ku Klux Statute by the State of Tennessee,
several instances occurred of parties being arrested in Ku Klux disguises;
but in every case they proved to be either negroes or “radical” Brownlow
Republicans. This occurred so often that the statute was allowed by the
party in power to become a dead letter before its repeal. It bore too hard
on the “loyal” men when enforced.</p>

<p>The Ku Klux Klan was a great Law and Order League of mounted night
cavalrymen called into action by the intolerable conditions of a reign of
terror.... It was the old answer of organized manhood to organized crime
masquerading under the forms of government.... Women and children had eyes
and saw not, ears and heard not. Over four hundred thousand disguises for
men and horses were made by the women of the South, and not one secret
ever passed their lips!</p>

it. Men, women, and children must have, and be worthy of, implicit mutual
trust. They must be trusted with the secrets of life and death without
reserve and without fear.</p>

<p>The importance of this brilliant exploit was destined to be far greater
than even Clark foresaw, for when the treaty of peace was being negotiated
at Paris in 1782, our allies, France and Spain, were both more than
willing to sacrifice our interests in order to keep us out of the
Mississippi Valley, and the western boundary of the United States would
undoubtedly have been fixed at the Alleghanies instead of the Mississippi,
but for the fact that this western region was actually occupied by
Virginians.</p>

<p>IN THE PETERSBURG TRENCHES</p>

<p>Winter poured down its snows and its sleets upon Lee’s shelterless men in
the trenches. Some of them burrowed into the earth. Most of them shivered
over the feeble fires, kept burning along the lines. Scanty and thin were
the garments of these heroes. Most of them were clad in mere rags. Gaunt
famine oppressed them every hour. One quarter of a pound of bacon and a
little meal was the daily portion assigned to each man by the rules of the
War Department. But even this allowance failed when the railroads broke
down and left the bacon and the flour piled up beside the tracks in
Georgia and the Carolinas. One sixth of this daily ration was the
allotment for a considerable time, and very often the supply of bacon
failed entirely....</p>

<p>The war began, the war went on&mdash;this politicians’ conspiracy, this
slaveholders’ rebellion, as it was variously called by those who sought
its source, now in the disappointed ambition of the Southern leaders, now
in the desperate determination of a slaveholding oligarchy to perpetuate
their power, and to secure forever their proprietorship in their “human
chattels.” On this theory the mass of the Southern people were but puppets
in the hands of political wirepullers, or blind followers of hectoring
“patricians.” To those who know the Southern people nothing can be more
absurd; to those who know their personal independence, to those who know
the deep interest which they have always taken in politics, the keen
intelligence with which they have always followed the questions of the
day.</p>

I hear the bluebird’s quaint soliloquy,&mdash;<br />
A hesitating note upon the breeze,<br />
Blown faintly from the tops of distant trees,<br />
As though he were not sure that Spring is nigh,<br />
But fed his hopes with bursts of melody.<br />
I would I had a spirit-harp to seize<br />
The bolder tenor of his rhapsodies<br />
When apple-blossoms swing against the sky.<br />
On every dark or blust’ring wintry day<br />
That airy harp the bluebird’s lilt should play;<br />
And as I held my sighs and paused to hear,<br />
The wand’ring message, with its full-fed cheer<br />
And ripe contentment, to my life should bring<br />
The essence and fruition of the Spring.<br />

great novel on that life and death struggle between politicians and races
in the land of cotton and sugar plantations, the swamps and bayous of the
mighty Mississippi, where the Carpet-Bag Government had a standing army,
of blacks, chiefly, and a navy of warships going up and down waterways.”</p>

upheld the best traditions of the American navy; but history must bear
witness to the fact that, if not overmatched or defeated, she at least
withdrew to shallow water, where the <i>Virginia</i> could not follow her; and
later, under the guns of Ft. Monroe, she declined the subsequent battle
challenges of the refitted <i>Virginia</i>.</p>

<p>A HUMOROUS VIEW OF “THE HUB”</p>

<p>For the native Bostonian there are three paths to glory. If his name be
Quincy or Adams, nothing more is expected of him. His blue blood carries
him through life with glory, and straight to heaven when he dies. Failing
in the happy accident of birth, the candidate for Beacon Hill honors must
write a book. This is easy. The man who can breathe Boston air and not
write a book is either a fool or a phenomenon. One course remains to him
should he miss fame in these lines. He must be a reformer.</p>

a community wherein no man was to be molested for his faith.</p>

<p>A great event of this [Tyler’s] administration was the Ashburton Treaty.
This settled our northeast boundary for 200 miles and warded off the long
impending war with England. In most histories the whole credit for this
treaty is given to Daniel Webster. Of course this great man should not be
robbed of any of his well-earned laurels; but the President is entitled to
a share of the honor. Webster himself said: “It proceeded from step to
step under the President’s own immediate eye and correction.” Moreover, it
may be added that at one stage in the proceedings Lord Ashburton was about
to give up and return to England; but President Tyler by his courtesy and
suavity, conciliated him and induced him to go on with the negotiation.</p>

<p>In discussing the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, Senator Hale warned Senator Toombs
that the North would fight. The Georgian answered: “I believe nobody ever
doubted that any portion of the United States would fight on a proper
occasion.... There are courageous and honest men enough in both sections
to fight. There is no question of courage involved. The people of both
sections of the Union have illustrated their courage on too many
battlefields to be questioned. They have shown their fighting qualities
shoulder to shoulder whenever their country has called upon them; but that
they may never come in contact with each other in a fratricidal war should
be the ardent wish and earnest desire of every true man and honest
patriot.”</p>

<p>CALHOUN’S NATIONALISM</p>

<p>At the peace of 1815 the Government was $120,000,000 in debt; its revenues
were small; its credit not great, and the effort to raise money by direct
taxation brought it in conflict with the States.... Mr. Calhoun came
forward and devised a tariff, which not only gave large revenues to the
Government, but gave great protection to manufacturers. Mr. Calhoun
received unmeasured abuse for his pains from the North, where the
interests were then navigation, and Daniel Webster was the great apostle
of free trade.... Under Mr. Calhoun’s tariff the New England manufacturers
prospered rapidly.... Success stimulated cupidity, and the “black tariff”
of 1828 marked the growth of abuse.... It was then that Mr. Calhoun again
stepped forth. He stated that the South had cheerfully paid the enormous
burden of duties on imports when Northern manufactures were young and the
Government weak; the manufacturers had become rich, and the Government
strong&mdash;so strong that State rights were being merged into its
overshadowing power; he therefore demanded a recognition of State rights,
and an amelioration of those burdens that the South had so long borne.</p>

<p>From this time a clear-cut issue was formulated and presented to the
States and the people. The “firing upon the flag of the nation” was made
the immediate pretext for aggressive measures against the Lower South. <i>As
so heralded</i>, it served to inflame the hearts of thousands who, it seems,
had not noticed or who had forgotten, as it is forgotten to-day, that this
was not the first firing upon the Stars and Stripes. The flag had been
fired upon from the coast of South Carolina as early as January 9, 1861,
for the same reason as that which provoked attack upon it on April 12.</p>

<p>There was but one exception to the general grief too remarkable to be
passed over in silence. Among the extreme Radicals in Congress, Mr.
Lincoln’s determined clemency and liberality towards the Southern people
had made an impression so unfavorable that, though they were shocked at
his murder, they did not, among themselves, conceal gratification that he
was no longer in their way.</p>

<p>The Union League of America was organized in Cleveland, Ohio, during the
war by friends of Thaddeus Stevens, the Radical leader of Congress. Its
prime object was the confiscation of the property of the South. The chief
obstacle to this program was Abraham Lincoln. Hence the first work of the
League was to form a conspiracy against Lincoln and prevent his
renomination for a second term.</p>

<p>I have only to say that the militia will not be furnished to the powers at
Washington for any such use or purpose as they have in view. Your object
is to subjugate the Southern States, and a requisition made upon me for
such an object&mdash;an object, in my judgment, not within the purview of the
constitution or the act of 1795&mdash;will not be complied with. You have
chosen to inaugurate civil war, and having done so, we will meet it in a

<p>Having completed our repairs on May 8th, and while returning to our old
anchorage, we heard heavy firing, and, going down the harbor, found the
<i>Monitor</i>, with the iron-clads <i>Galena</i>, <i>Naugatuck</i>, and a number of
heavy ships, shelling our batteries at Sewell’s Point. We stood directly
for the <i>Monitor</i>, but as we approached they all ceased firing and
retreated below the forts.</p>

<p>Throughout the events that led up to the Revolution, it seemed ordained
that Massachusetts was to suffer and Virginia to sympathize. Until the
outbreak of actual hostilities scarcely anything of moment occurred on the
soil of Virginia to incite her sons to champion the cause of freedom.
Indeed, from the beginning of the controversy between the colonies and the
mother country, the British Ministry seemed to have avoided any special
cause of irritation to the people of the Old Dominion. The part,
therefore, which Virginia took in the events of those days must be
attributed to her devotion to the principles of liberty, to her interest
in the common cause of the colonies, and particularly to her sympathy with
Massachusetts in the suffering which that province was called upon to
endure. If we lose sight of these motives as the springs of Virginia’s
conduct in that struggle, we shall be unable to appreciate either the
nobility of her spirit or the wisdom and energy which marked her
initiative.</p>

At midnight, in the month of June,<br />
I stand beneath the mystic moon.<br />
An opiate vapor, dewy, dim,<br />
Exhales from out her golden rim,<br />
And, softly dripping, drop by drop,<br />
Upon the quiet mountain top,<br />
Steals drowsily and musically<br />
Into the universal valley.<br />
The rosemary nods upon the grave;<br />
The lily lolls upon the wave;<br />
Wrapping the fog above its breast,<br />

<p>In regard to African Slavery, which has played so important a part in our
political history, Randolph was an Emancipationist, as distinguished from
an Abolitionist. This distinction was a very broad one; as broad as that
between Algernon Sidney and Jack Cade; or between Charlemagne and Peter
the Hermit&mdash;in fact, it was the difference between Reason and Fanaticism.
On this subject Randolph and Clay concurred; both were Emancipationists,
and both denounced the Abolitionists; as did also Webster, and all the
best, wisest, and purest men of that day.</p>

<p>The band preceding the coffin smote on their ears with poignant loud
lamenting, then carried its sorrow to die moaning on the night. As the

hearse&mdash;a horse, riderless, with boots empty in the stirrups, following&mdash;a
few soldiers carrying arms reversed&mdash;a single carriage with mourners&mdash;the

meantime, in spite of the armor of the <i>Kearsarge</i>, I lodged a rifled
percussion shell near her stern post&mdash;<i>where there were no chains</i>&mdash;which
failed to explode because of the defect of the cap. On so slight an

which he would colonize the new empire; here the Jamestown experiment
succeeded, after Raleigh’s head had fallen on the block; the Revolution
was fired by the eloquence of Patrick Henry, and was consummated at
Yorktown; the War of 1812 was settled by the victories of North Point and
Fort McHenry; the crisis of the Civil War occurred; and seven Presidents

<p>AN AMUSING COMMENTARY ON THE MAKING OF SOME HISTORIES</p>

<p>I have here a small volume entitled, “John Randolph, by Henry Adams.” It
is one of a series called “American Statesmen,” and emanates from the thin
air of Boston. The series is edited by Mr. J. T. Morse, Jr. By what law of
selection he has been governed in allotting to particular authors the
preparation of respective biographies it is impossible to divine. It is
quite clear, however, that he has not followed any rule of qualification
or congeniality hitherto recognized by men or angels. For example, a
foreigner, Dr. Von Holtz, who, in an emphatically European and un-American
treatise on the Federal Constitution, had already denounced Calhoun as a
kind of Lucifer, is appointed his biographer; Henry Clay, the father of
Protection (as it is called), is assigned to Carl Schurz, who, I
understand, is an ardent advocate of Free Trade; while John Randolph is
turned over to the tender mercies of a descendant of the first
Vice-President, and the grandson of John Quincy Adams!</p>

<p>Had this unique law of selection prevailed hitherto, we might have had a
biography of Luther by Leo the Tenth; a life of St. Thomas Aquinas by
Thomas Payne; while Pontius Pilate, or more likely the devil himself,
would have been selected to chronicle the divine career of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>A PROPHECY, 1869</p>

<p>The close of the Civil War found the conquering States so nearly equally
divided between the Radical and Conservative parties, that if the South
should be restored to her relative might in the Union, the balance would
be thrown at once in favor of the Conservatives. The problem therefore
assumed a mathematical form, and demanded that the South should not
reinforce the Conservatives of the North. This could be prevented only in
two ways, <i>viz.</i>; either by keeping the South out of the Union entirely or
by placing the political power there in the hands of a minority. To adopt
one or the other of these expedients was a party necessity. This is the
whole key to Reconstruction; and fifty years hence no man living will be
found to deny it.</p>

<p>A SOUTHERN SOLDIER’S TRIBUTE</p>

<p>To the Union commander, General George Gordon Meade, history will accord
the honor of having handled his army at Gettysburg with unquestioned
ability. The record and the results of the battle entitle him to a high
place among Union leaders. To him and to his able subordinates and heroic
men is due the credit of having successfully met and repelled the Army of
Northern Virginia in the meridian of its hope and confidence and power.</p>

<p>General Lee distinctly ordered Longstreet to attack early the morning of
the second day, and if he had done so, two of the largest corps of Meade’s
army would not have been in the fight; but Longstreet delayed the attack
until four o’clock in the afternoon, and thus lost his opportunity of
occupying Little Round Top, the key to the position, which he might have
done in the morning without firing a shot or losing a man.</p>

<p>General Lee ordered Longstreet to attack at daybreak on the morning of the
third day.... He did not attack until two or three o’clock in the
afternoon, the artillery opening at one.... Nothing that occurred at
Gettysburg, nor anything that has been written since of that battle, has
lessened the conviction that, had Lee’s orders been promptly and cordially
executed, Meade’s centre on the third day would have been penetrated and
the Union Army overwhelmingly defeated.</p>

<p>General Lee, according to the testimony of Colonel Walter H. Taylor,
Colonel C. S. Venable, and General A. L. Long, who were present when the
order was given, ordered Longstreet to make the attack on the last day,
with the three divisions of his corps, and two divisions of A. P. Hill’s
corps, and that instead of doing so he sent fourteen thousand men to
assail Meade’s army in his strong position, and heavily intrenched.</p>

<p>And to defenders and besiegers it is alike unjust to say, even though it
has been said by the highest authority, that Port Hudson surrendered only
because Vicksburg had fallen. The simple truth is that Port Hudson
surrendered because its hour had come. The garrison was literally
starving. With less than 3000 famished men in line, powerful mines beneath
the salients, and a last assault about to be delivered at 10 places, what
else was left to do?</p>

<p>FACT OR FICTION?</p>

<p>For four years the Northern States fought to keep their Southern sisters
in the Federal family; then having soundly thrashed these sisters in order
to keep them at home, they suddenly shut the door and kicked them down the
steps! The “erring sisters” are now fully restored to the family circle;
but they had a longer and more painful struggle in the effort to get back
than in the attempt to get away. More briefly, for four years the Federal
government, led by Lincoln, maintained that all of the Southern States
were in the Union and could not get out; and then for five years, under
the rule of the Radicals, it argued that some of these States were out of
the Union and could not get in!</p>

<p>Uncle Remus was quite a fogy in his idea of negro education. One day a
number of negro children, on their way home from school, were impudent to
the old man, and he was giving them an untempered piece of his mind, when
a gentleman apologized for them by saying: “Oh well, they are school
children. You know how they are.”</p>

served the whole seven years for your independence.... Was it for this
that you turned me, my young daughter and little son out upon the world
without a shelter? Or was it because my husband was the grandson of the
Revolutionary patriot and “rebel,” Richard Henry Lee, and the near kinsman
of the noblest of Christian warriors, the greatest of generals, Robert E.
Lee?... <i>Your</i> name will stand on history’s page as the Hunter of weak
women and innocent children; the Hunter to destroy defenseless villages

<p>It was probably the most remarkable evidence on record of the
resourcefulness of the Anglo-Saxon race, and its ability and determination
to dominate. Driven to desperation by conditions that threatened to
destroy their civilization, the citizens of the South, through this
organization, turned upon their enemies, overwhelmed them, and became
again masters of their own soil ... and its proper use must be commended
by all good men everywhere, for by it was preserved the purest Anglo-Saxon
civilization of this nation.</p>

<p>The Southampton Insurrection, which occurred in August, 1831, was one of
those untoward incidents which so often marked the history of slavery.
Under the leadership of one Nat Turner, a negro preacher of some
education, who felt that he had been called of God to deliver his race
from bondage, the negroes attacked the whites at night, and before the
assault could be suppressed, fifty-seven whites, principally women and
children, had been killed. This deplorable event assumed an even more
portentous aspect when it was realized that the leader was a slave to whom
the privilege of education had been accorded, and that one of his
lieutenants was a free negro. In addition, there existed a wide-spread
belief among the whites that influences and instigations from without the
State were responsible for the insurrection.</p>

the Abolitionists in the North came as an even more powerful factor to
embarrass the efforts of the Virginia emancipators. Unlike the
anti-slavery men of former years, this new school not only attacked the
institution of slavery, but the morality of the slaveholders and their
sympathizers. In their fierce arraignment, not only were the humane and
considerate linked in infamy with the cruel and intolerant, but the whole
population of the slave-holding States, their civilization and their
morals were the object of unrelenting and incessant assaults.</p>

rendering himself an abettor of the slave-holder in his sin.”</p>

<p>His last campaign alone, even ending as it did in defeat, would have
sufficed to fix him forever as a star of the first magnitude in the
constellation of great captains. Though he succumbed at last to the
“policy of attrition,” pursued by his patient and able antagonist, it was
not until Grant had lost in the campaign over 124,000 men, better armed
and equipped&mdash;two men for every one that Lee had had in his army from the
beginning of the campaign.</p>

<p>By the recognized universal public law of all the earth, war dissolves all
political compacts. Our forefathers gave as one of their grounds for
asserting their independence that the King of Great Britain had “abdicated
government here by declaring us out of his protection and waging war upon
us.” The people and the Government of the Northern States of the late
Union have acted in the same manner toward Missouri, and have dissolved,
by war, the connection heretofore existing between her and them.</p>

<p>Very soon after, the Essex was seen approaching under full steam. Stevens,
as humane as he was true and brave, finding that he could not bring a
single gun to bear upon the coming foe, sent all his people over the bows
ashore, remaining alone to set fire to his vessel; this he did so
effectually that he had to jump from the stern into the river and save
himself by swimming; and with colors flying, the gallant <i>Arkansas</i>, whose
decks had never been pressed by the foot of an enemy, was blown into the

that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of making voters or jurors of
negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor inter-marry with white
people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical
difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever
forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political
equality. And, inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain
together, there must be the position of superior and inferior; and I, as
much as any other man, am in favor of having the superior position
assigned to the white race.</p>

<p>The radicals and negroes had, in the summer of 1867, refused to
“co-operate” with the representative white citizens in restoring political
and social order. The election of delegates to the constitutional
convention was held in October, 1867. About 94,000 negroes voted. The
radical majority included five foreign born, twenty-five negroes,
twenty-eight Northerners, and fourteen Virginians. Never before in the
history of the State had negroes sat in a law-making body. The former
political leaders were absent. The State had been revolutionized.</p>

adversary, and beat him when found, whose policy has been attack and not
defense. I presume that I have been called here to pursue the same
system.... It is my purpose to do so, and that speedily.... Meanwhile, I
desire you to dismiss from your minds certain phrases, which I am sorry to
find much in vogue amongst you. I hear constantly of taking strong
positions and holding them&mdash;of lines of retreat and of bases of supplies.
Let us discard such ideas.... Let us study the probable line of our

<p>STONEWALL JACKSON’S MEN HELP THEMSELVES TO POPE’S SUPPLIES, 1862</p>

<p>Weak and haggard from their diet of green corn and apples, one can well
imagine with what surprise their eyes opened upon the contents of the
sutler’s stores, containing an amount and variety of property such as they
had never conceived. Then came a storming charge of men rushing in a
tumultuous mob over each other’s heads, under each other’s feet, anywhere,
everywhere to satisfy a craving stronger than a yearning for fame. There
were no laggards in that charge.... Men ragged and famished clutched
tenaciously at whatever came in their way, and whether of clothing or
food, of luxury or necessity. A long yellow-haired, bare-footed son of the
South claimed as prizes a tooth-brush, a box of candles, a barrel of
coffee. From piles of new clothing the Southerners arrayed themselves in
the blue uniforms of the Federals. The naked were clad, the barefooted
were shod, and the sick provided with luxuries to which they had long been
strangers.</p>

<p>In the rapidity with which the opportunity was seized, in the combination
of the three arms, and in the vigor of the blow, Manassas is in no way
inferior to Austerlitz or Salamanca. That the result was less decisive was
due to the greater difficulties of the battle-field, to the stubborn
resistance of the enemy, to the obstacles in the way of rapid and
connected movement, and to the inexperience of the troops.</p>

<p>On this point, however, all parties in the South were agreed, and the vast
majority of the people of the North&mdash;before the war. The Abolitionist
proper was considered not so much a friend of the negro as the enemy of
society. As the war went on, and the Abolitionist saw the “glory of the
Lord” revealed in a way he had never hoped for, he saw at the same time,
or rather ought to have seen, that the order he had lived to destroy could
not have been a system of hellish wrong and fiendish cruelty; else the
prophetic vision of the liberators would have been fulfilled, and the
horrors of San Domingo would have polluted this fair land. For the negro
race does not deserve undivided praise for its conduct during the war. Let
some small part of the credit be given to the masters, not all to the
finer qualities of their “brothers in black.” The school in which the
training was given is closed, and who wishes to open it? Its methods were
old-fashioned and were sadly behind the times, but the old schoolmasters
turned out scholars who, in certain branches of moral philosophy, were not
inferior to the graduates of the new university.</p>

<p>If slavery were an unutterably evil institution, with no alleviating
features, how are we to account for the fact that when the Confederate
soldiers were at the front fighting, as they thought, for their
independence, the negroes on the plantations took care of the women and
children and old people, and nothing like an act of violence was ever
known among them?... Is it not perfectly evident that there was a great
rebellion, but that the rebels were the Northerners and that those who
defended the Constitution as it was were the Southerners; but they
defended State rights and slavery, which were distinctly intrenched within
the Constitution?</p>

<p>OF JAMES RUMSEY, INVENTOR OF THE FIRST STEAMBOAT</p>

<p>I have seen the model of Mr. Rumsey’s boat, constructed to work against
the stream, examined the powers upon which it acts, been the eye witness
to an actual experiment in running water of some rapidity, and give it as
my opinion (although I had little faith before) that he has discovered the
art of working boats by mechanism and small manual assistance against
rapid currents; that the discovery is of vast importance; may be of the
greatest usefulness in our inland navigation, and if it succeeds (of which
I have no doubt) that the value of it is greatly enhanced by the
simplicity of the works; which, when seen and explained, may be executed
by the most common mechanic.</p>

of Virginia, this 7th day of September, 1784.</p>

<p>Long and close association with the white race had its civilizing effect
upon the negroes, and it was not long before the two races became warmly
attached, both alike manifesting a keen interest in the other’s welfare.
Thus as economic interests had fixed the system in the laws of the people,
the domestication of the race fixed it in their hearts. The abolitionist
was right in his position on the ethics of slavery, but more than
benighted in his conception of its condition in the South.</p>

<p>LEE’S ORDER OF INVASION, 1862</p>

<p>That he did not reap the full fruits of this wonderful generalship was due
to one of those strange events which, so insignificant in itself, yet is
fateful to decide the issues of nations....</p>

<p>It will be seen that Lee had no doubt whatever of the success of his
undertaking. Both he and Jackson knew Harper’s Ferry and the surrounding
country, and his plan, so simple and yet so complete, was laid out with a
precision as absolute as if formed on the ground instead of on the march
in a new country. It was this order showing the dispersion of his army
over twenty-odd miles of country, with a river flowing between its widely
scattered parts, that by a strange fate fell in McClellan’s hands.</p>

<p>General Jackson, after a brief dispatch to General Lee announcing the
capitulation, rode up to Bolivar and down into Harper’s Ferry. The
curiosity of the Union Army to see him was so great that the soldiers
lined the sides of the road. Many of them uncovered as he passed, and he
invariably returned the salute. One man had an echo of response all about
him when he said aloud: “Boys, he’s not much for looks, but if we’d had
him we wouldn’t have been caught in this trap.”</p>

<p>The moon, rising above the mountains, revealed the long lines of men and
guns, stretching far across hill and valley, waiting for the dawn to shoot
each other down, and between the armies their dead lay in such numbers as
civilised war has seldom seen. So fearful had been the carnage, and
comprised within such narrow limits, that a Federal patrol, it is related,
passing into the corn-field, where the fighting had been fiercest,
believed that they had surprised a whole Confederate brigade. There, in
the shadow of the woods, lay the skirmishers, their muskets beside them;
and there, in regular ranks, lay the line of battle, sleeping, as it
seemed, the profound sleep of utter exhaustion. But the first man that was
touched was cold and lifeless, and the next, and the next; it was the
bivouac of the dead.</p>

<p>As a deputation from New England was one day leaving the White House, a
delegate turned round and said: “Mr. President, I should much like to know
what you reckon to be the number the rebels have in arms against us?”</p>

<p>Without a moment’s hesitation Mr. Lincoln replied: “Sir, I have the best
possible reason for knowing the number to be one million of men, for
whenever one of our generals engages a rebel army he reports that he has
encountered a force twice his strength. I know we have half a million
soldiers, so I am bound to believe that the rebels have twice that
number.”</p>

percentage of loss at Solferino and Magenta; five times greater than that
of Napoleon at Wagram, and about ten times as heavy as that of Marshall
Saxe at Bloody Raucoux.... Or, if we take the average percentage of loss
in a number of the world’s great battles&mdash;Waterloo, Wagram, Valmy,

Trip a light measure with the hurrying leaf,<br />
Straining thy few late roses to thy breast:<br />
With laughter overgay, sweet eyes drooped down,<br />

Dare not to pause for rest<br />
Lest the slow tears should gather to their fall.<br />

<p>It is no small achievement to have sung a few imperishable songs of
bereaved love and illusive beauty. It is no small achievement to have
produced individual and unexcelled strains of harmony which have since so
rung in the ears of brother poets that echoes of them may be detected even
in the work of such original and accomplished versemen as Rossetti and
Swinburne. It is no small achievement to have pursued one’s ideal until
one’s dying day, conscious the while that, great as one’s impediments have
been from without, one’s chief obstacle has been one’s own self.</p>

bravery; implicit obedience to orders without a question or cavil; and the

<p>Her right to it rested upon as firm a basis as the right of any other
Commonwealth to her own domain, and if there was any question of the
Virginia title by charter, she could assert her right by conquest. The
region had been wrested from the British by a Virginian commanding
Virginian troops; the people had taken “the oath of allegiance to the
Commonwealth of Virginia”; and her title to the entire territory was thus
indisputable....</p>

<p>These rights she now abandoned; and her action was the result of an
enlarged patriotism and devotion to the cause of union.</p>

<p>When social relations were resumed between the North and South&mdash;they
followed slowly the resumption of business relations&mdash;what we should call
the color-blindness of the other side often manifested itself in a
delicate reticence on the part of our Northern friends; and as the war had
by no means constituted their lives as it had constituted ours for four
long years, the success in avoiding the disagreeable topic would have been
considerable, if it had not been for awkward allusions on the part of the
Southerners, who, having been shut out for all that time from the study of
literature and art and other elegant and uncompromising subjects, could
hardly keep from speaking of this and that incident of the war. Whereupon
a discreet, or rather an embarrassed silence, as if a pardoned convict had
playfully referred to the arson or burglary, not to say worse, that had
been the cause of his seclusion.</p>

supplied to a very large extent his unfortunate want of military
education. His military career teaches us that the genius which makes men
great soldiers is not art of war.</p>

Sad-hearted Spirit of the solitudes,<br />
Who comest through the ruin-wedded woods!<br />
Gray-gowned in fog, gold-girdled with the gloom<br />
Of tawny sunsets; burdened with perfume<br />
Of rain-wet uplands, chilly with the mist;<br />
And all the beauty of the fire-kissed<br />
Cold forests crimsoning thy indolent way,<br />
Odorous of death and drowsy with decay.<br />
I think of thee as seated ’mid the showers<br />
Of languid leaves that cover up the flowers&mdash;<br />
The little flower-sisterhoods, whom June<br />
Once gave wild sweetness to, as to a tune<br />
A singer gives her soul’s wild melody&mdash;<br />
Watching the squirrel store his granary.<br />
Or, ’mid old orchards, I have pictured thee:<br />
Thy hair’s profusion blown about thy back;<br />
One lovely shoulder bathed with gypsy black;<br />
Upon thy palm one nestling cheek, and sweet<br />
The rosy russets tumbled at thy feet.<br />
Was it a voice lamenting for the flowers?<br />
Or heart-sick bird that sang of happier hours?<br />
A cricket dirging days that soon must die?<br />
Or did the ghost of Summer wander by?<br />

ballot, but their right to life, liberty, property, and justice must be
even more carefully safeguarded than ever. It is true that a superior race
cannot submit to the rule of a weaker race without injury; it is also true
in the long years of God that the strong cannot oppress the weak without
destruction.</p>

<p>When it was ascertained that exchanges could not be made, either on the
basis of the cartel, or officer for officer and man for man, I was
instructed by the Confederate authorities to offer the United States
Government their sick and wounded, <i>without requiring any equivalents</i>.
Accordingly, in the summer of 1864, I did offer to deliver from ten to
fifteen thousand of the sick and wounded at the mouth of the Savannah
River, without requiring any equivalents, assuring, at the same time, the
Agent of the United States, General Mulford, that if the number for which
he might send transportation could not readily be made up from sick and
wounded, I would supply the difference with well men. Although this offer
was made in the summer of 1864, transportation was not sent to the
Savannah River until about the middle or last of November.</p>

Federal prisoners. I offered to pay gold, cotton, or tobacco for them, and
even two or three prices, if required. At the same time I gave assurances
that the medicines would be used exclusively in the treatment of Federal
prisoners; and moreover agreed, on behalf of the Confederate States, if it
was insisted on, that such medicines might be brought into the Confederate
lines by the United States surgeons, and dispensed by them.</p>

<p>In other words, a veteran of our civil strife, General Sherman advocated
in an enemy’s country the sixteenth century practices of Tilly, described
by Schiller, and the later devastation of the Palatinate policy of Louis
XIV, commemorated by Goethe. In the twenty-first century, perhaps,
partisan feeling as regards the Civil War performances having by that time
ceased to exist, American investigators, no longer regardful of a victor’s
self-complacency, may treat the episodes of our struggle with the same
even-handed and out-spoken impartiality with which Englishmen now treat
the revenges of the Restoration, or Frenchmen the dragonnades of the Grand
Monarque. But when that time comes, the page relating to what occurred in
1864 in the Valley of the Shenandoah, in Georgia, and in the Carolinas,&mdash;a
page which Mr. Rhodes somewhat lightly passes over&mdash;will probably be
rewritten in characters of far more decided import.</p>

latter holding the lion’s share of the offices. The lieutenant-governor,
secretary of state, superintendent of education, and commissioner of
immigration and agriculture, all were negroes; both houses of the
legislature had negro presiding officers; in the senate ten negroes held
seats; of the seventy-seven Republicans in the house, fifty-five were

offices were filled by negroes, 90 per cent. of whom could neither read

<p>The majority in Congress, in imposing protecting duties, which are utterly
destructive of the interests of South Carolina, not only impose no
burthens, but actually confer enriching bounties upon their constituents,
proportioned to the burthens they impose upon us. Under these
circumstances, the principle of representative responsibility is perverted
into a principle of representative despotism. It is this very tie, binding
the majority of Congress to execute the will of their constituents, which
makes them our inexorable oppressors. They dare not open their hearts to
the sentiments of human justice, or to the feelings of human sympathy.
They are tyrants by the very necessity of their position, however elevated
may be their principles in their individual capacities.</p>

cannot exist without the other. A reasoning being would lose his reason,

been no God mankind would have been obliged to imagine one.</p>

<p>For years after the war, the Republican politicians in the South told the
negroes that if the Democrats were elected, they would be put back into
slavery. Consequently, after the first election of Cleveland, many of them
began to make their arrangements to readapt themselves to the old regime.

she was ready to return to Richmond; but declared most positively: “Deed,

<p>Sir:&mdash;If you have no cause to change your opinion respecting your
mechanical boat, and reasons unknown to me do not exist to delay the
exhibition of it, I would advise you to give it to the public as soon as
it can be prepared conveniently.... Should a mechanical genius hit upon
your plan, or something similar to it, I need not add that it would place
you in an awkward situation and perhaps disconcert all your prospects
concerning this useful discovery....</p>

against the current of the <i>Mississippi</i> or <i>Ohio</i> rivers, or in the <i>Gulf

hundred miles per day. I know this will appear strange and improbable to

<p>On part of the field the Union dead lay three deep. So fearful was the

they pressed forward in the face of despair, and they fell in the
unshrinking station where they fought. In six months Lee had effaced Pope,

<p>The Convention of 1787 was composed of members, a majority of whom were

clause declaring that “the power granted under the Constitution being
derived from the people of the United States, may be resumed by them
whensoever the same shall be perverted to their injury and oppression, and
that every power not granted thereby remains with them at their will,” was
inserted in the ordinance of ratification, that six or more of the
majority opposed to the measure consented to vote for it. Even with this
accession of strength the Constitution was carried only by a vote of 89 to

<p class="poem">
’Tis midnight’s holy hour&mdash;and silence now<br />
Is brooding, like a gentle spirit, o’er<br />
The still and pulseless world. Hark! on the winds,<br />
The bells’ deep notes are swelling. ’Tis the knell<br />
Of the departed year. No funeral train<br />
Is sweeping past; yet on the stream and wood,<br />
With melancholy light, the moonbeams rest<br />
Like a pale, spotless shroud; the air is stirred,<br />
As by a mourner’s sigh; and on yon cloud,<br />
That floats so still and placidly through heaven,<br />
The spirits of the seasons seem to stand&mdash;<br />
Young Spring, bright Summer, Autumn’s solemn form,<br />
And Winter, with his aged locks&mdash;and breathe<br />
In mournful cadences, that come abroad<br />
Like the far wind harp’s wild and touching wail,<br />
A melancholy dirge o’er the dead Year,<br />
Gone from the earth forever.<br />
